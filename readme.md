## Mini Pokedex

See: [Boilerplate Getting Started](gettingStarted.md) for information on how I setted up this project boilerplate.


This is a small project in which I intend to create a small pokedex display based on raw data. It is supposed to run offline.
Although API calls could eventually be incorporated to obtain pokemon information properly, but I want it to be offline and *relatively* fast (it's electron tho).
